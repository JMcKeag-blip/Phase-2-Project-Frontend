Planet Explorer Application
An application designed to help you browse the many planets in the galaxy. Planets uploaded to the backend of this project exist in the fictional world of Star Wars and therefor all pre-loaded planets do not exist in real life, though portions of the applications functionality will allow for you to add your own planets to the list, both fictional and real.

Description:
This SPA is a simple tool that allows you to browse planets, add your own into the database and save planets for future reference into a separate travel Itinerary field once we finally master sub-light travel!

Project Info:
This project uses React.js as a Front-End as well as a seperate json file as a Back-End. The backend for this project which is needed to have this project work can be found [here](https://github.com/JMcKeag-blip/Phase-2-Project-Backend).

Setup:
Back-End:
First you will need to fork and clone the backend for this project. Once again found Here. After this is cloned you can start this server by moving down into its directory that was just created and running npm run dev. This should get the backend of the server fully up and running. You should see a notification in the terminal saying that your server is running on port 3001 if this has been set up correctly. Keep this up and running.

Front-End:
Now for the Front-End, fork and clone this project down to your environment. Once cloned move down into this new directory and use npm start to launch the browser view of the project. If successfully run you should see in the terminal that there is a localhost now running on port 3000 or your default port to start your applications on. Also the browser should now open, or open a new tab with the project now running.

How to use this App:
This app has a home page that will be loaded with a bunch of information on how to fully use the app. The main way to use this app is to navigate the different tabs and pages of this SPA using the buttons across the top of the page. The bright yellow button will be the current page you are on. There will also be information on each page letting you know what it is for.
